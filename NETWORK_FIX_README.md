# Network Request Failed - Fix Applied

## Problem
The app was showing `Network request failed` errors because it was configured to use `localhost`, which doesn't work on physical devices or emulators.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Frontend Configuration
**File:** `.env`
- Changed `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST` from `"localhost"` to `"192.168.1.9"`
- This is your computer's current network IP address

### 2. Updated Backend CORS Settings
**File:** `iyaya-backend/.env`
- Added `http://192.168.1.9:8081` and `http://192.168.1.9:19006` to `CORS_ORIGIN`
- This allows the frontend to make requests from these origins

## Next Steps

### To Apply the Fix:

1. **Restart the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd iyaya-backend
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C if running)
   npm start
   ```

2. **Restart the Frontend App:**
   ```bash
   # In the root directory
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. **Verify the Connection:**
   - Open the app on your device/emulator
   - The API requests should now work

## Important Notes

- **IP Address Changes:** If your computer's IP address changes (e.g., you connect to a different WiFi network), you'll need to update `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST` in `.env` again
- **Get Current IP:** Run `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux) to find your current IP
- **Same Network:** Make sure your phone/emulator is on the same WiFi network as your computer

## Testing the Connection

You can test if the backend is accessible by running:
```powershell
.\test-connection.ps1
```

This will test both localhost and network IP connectivity.

## Alternative: Use Localhost (Desktop Only)

If you're only testing on a desktop browser or web emulator, you can change back to:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST="localhost"
```

But this won't work for:
- Physical mobile devices
- Android/iOS emulators (in most cases)
- Expo Go app
